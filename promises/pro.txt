promise: it is an object that represents eventual completion or failure of an async operation.

promise can be consume or create.
const promiseOne = new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
    Do an async task
    DB calls,cryptography , network

}).

.then():- .then() is depends on reslove(paremeter if any) and .catch() is connected to reject()
resolve's paremeter'll pass to .then(e) (as given diff. name as variable)

-> consumption of above promise:
promiseOne.then(function(){
    
})
